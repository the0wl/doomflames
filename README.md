# doomflames
Small project using HTML and JS, inspired in a @filipedeschamps video and love by pixel art.

Abstracting the HTML contains a table 60x60 and the algorithm set a number from 0 to 37 to each cell, where 0 is white and 37 black, 
representing the heatness. The pallete color comes from a array with the values in rgb format and the effect in horizontal and vertical comes from a ramdom number subtracted with the position of painting and the heatness value.
